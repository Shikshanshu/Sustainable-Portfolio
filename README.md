After conducting the historical price data analysis of carbon intensive stocks (companies with higher carbon emission) and crabon efficient stocks (lower emission)
I found that carbon efficient stocks outperform the carbon intensive stocks in longer run.

Using this analysis I built an carbon efficient portfolio on the basis of Modern portfolio theory by Markowitz and the results were in line with the ESG driven portfolio
outperforming the normal portfolio.
